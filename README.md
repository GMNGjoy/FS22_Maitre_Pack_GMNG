# Maitre Pack Black Edition
This is an extented mod of the Maitre Pack of trailers by [NicoPix's / Nico Du 55](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mods.php?lang=en&country=cl&title=fs2022&filter=org&org_id=47623&page=0), which updates all trailers to be fully color selectable, and adds "Black Capacity" options to any trailers with a `fillUnit` (3x normal capacity)

- The original mod is available on ModHub (https://cdn69.giants-software.com/modHub/storage/00230460/FS22_Maitre_Pack.zip)

Both mods `FS22_Maitre_Pack.zip` & `FS22_Maitre_Pack_GMNG.zip` are required.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub on the releases page, save the [`FS22_Maitre_Pack_GMNG.zip` ] into your mod folder.
2. Download the Maitre Pack from ModHub, and put the zip [`FS22_Maitre_Pack.zip`] in your mod folder.
4. Launch the game, when selecting mods for use - if you only want the Black Edition versions, only check that mod. Checking the original mod is not required for the Black Editions to work - the original mod just needs to be in your mod folder, but doesn't need to be checked as one of your active mods when choosing mods.
5. Purchase the item in game as normal, and use as you would expect.
